This is mini project I developed to help me learn how to use and integrate various technologies that's why I included many technologies though some are not a periquisite for the site to function. 
I would appreciate your corrections as to how it can be better implemented. I am very passionate about open source development and would really appreciate your kind contributions to help me improve and be a vibrant member of the community.

This mini project utilises 
- twitter bootstrap4 ( used to create the nav bar)
- Jquery
- Slicebox(used to create the slideshow)

I will once again appreciate your contributions.
